# Bedrock haxe examples

These examples are intended to demo the [Bedrock haxe](http://github.com/Sendoushi/bedrock-haxe) framework.

For this project, node has been used node install dependencies so you can simply ```npm install```.
If you don't want to use node, simply ```git clone git@github.com/Sendoushi/bedrock-haxe.git node_modules/bedrock```.

You'll also need ```openfl``` installed globally. Eventually it will also be transformed in a npm dependency.

To run, go inside the folder of the example you want to run and ```npm run start```.
If you don't want to use node run ```openfl test neko```.

Some examples may not have the best approach but don't forget that they're done as framework examples not as production examples.
