# Code examples

Just different examples of development code.
The idea is to have various examples for a scalable app.
The app retrieves data from reddit and presents it.

To test you need to clone and follow the next instructions...

**NOTE:** For all examples node is needed

### Backbone + Bedrock (outdated at the moment)

```bash
git checkout bedrock
npm install
npm run start-prod
```

##### Size stats
- Build folder: **152kb**
- app.js: **141kb**

***Disclaimer:*** The structure and dependencies aren't exactly the same since this is the only updated branch.

```bash
git checkout redux-riot
npm install
npm run build prod
npm run server
```

##### Size stats
- Build folder: **135.4kb**
